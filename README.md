snø is an esolang I've made for Truttle1's 2023 esojam!

It is a 2D, stack-based esolang which has some bugs, because the esojam's theme was "It's not a bug, it's a feature" 

To run `main.sn` just type `python snø.py`, if you want to run another file, use `python snø.py path/to/file.sn`

## Commands

The interpreter ignores every other character than these, making them no-op

The IP's (`@`) default direction is bottom left

### IP direction commands

| Arrow | Direction        |
| ----- | ---------------- |
| `/`   | Bottom Left      |
| `\`   | Bottom Right     |
| `§`   | Random           |

| `0`-`F` | Push the corrisponding hex number as an integer                                    |
| `!`     | Pop the last value                                                                 |

| `O`     | Output the last value to the console then pop it                                   |
| `}`     | Swap the last two values                                                           |
| `$`     | Reverse the whole stack                                                            |
| `:`     | Duplicate the top value                                                            |
| `+`     | Add last two values together, leaving only the result                              |
| `-`     | Subtract last two values together, leaving only the result                         |
| `*`     | Multiply last two values together, leaving only the result                         |
| `|`     | Divide last two values together, leaving only the result                           |
| `^`     | Raise last two values together, leaving only the result                            |
| `%`     | Modulo last two values together, leaving only the result                           |
| `~`     | NOR bitwise operator (you can make any bitwise operator with this!)                |
| `Y`     | If number is non-zero, set direction to bottom left, set to bottom right otherwise |
| `&`     | End program                                                                        |

snø's arithmetic is NOS × TOS, meaning that it will duplicate the 2nd value on the stack by the last value on the stack

## Example programs

Here are some example programs! There are a lot of them (send help they spawn every single nanosecond I breathe)

### 1-byte cat [<img src="https://nukocities.neocities.org/nuko/act/cat1.gif">](https://github.com/mkukiro/nori.ni/tree/develop#cat-program-)

```sn
    @
   \·
  ··I··
 ····O··
······&··
```

### Demonstration of `Y`

```sn
      @
     \·
    ··I··
   ····Y··
  ····1·0··
 ····O···O··
····&·····&··
```

### Addition calculator

```sn
      @
     \·
    ··I··
   ····I··
  ······+··
 ········O··
··········&··
```

## Bugs

### This code doesn't run

```sn
   ·
  @@·
 II···
·······
```

The IP somehow cannot find the `@` so it just gives up
